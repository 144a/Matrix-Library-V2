# Matrix-Library-V2
Second Version of My Matrix Library for Processing that properly addresses certain operations whose scope was previously limited.

This version also uses a higher level of abstraction in comparison to my last one. This should simply future implementations of advanced Matrix Calculations, as well as the ability to document algorithms using proper Mathematical Notation. However, as this will clearly introduce more overhead, steps must be taken to reduce both memory usage and stack usage (the latter being more important for things like calculating determinants of larger matricies).
